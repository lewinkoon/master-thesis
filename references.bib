The book begins with a description of the Enterprise Performance Excellence ({EPE}) improvement methodology developed by the author that links several methodologies including systems thinking, theory of constraints, Lean and Six Sigma to provide an enterprise-wide prioritization and value-chain view of health care. The {EPE} methodology helps to improve flow at the macro or value-chain level, and then identifies Lean Six Sigma detailed improvements that can further improve processes within the value-chain. The book also provides real-world health care applications of the {EPE} and Lean Six Sigma methodologies that showed significant results on throughput, capacity, operational and financial performance. The Enterprise Performance Excellence methodology is described, and also the Six Sigma {DMAIC} (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) problem solving approach which is used to solve problems for health care processes as they are applied to real world cases. The case studies include a wide variety of processes and problems including: emergency department throughput improvement; operating room turnaround; operating room organization; {CT} imaging diagnostic test reduction in an emergency department; linen process improvement; implementing sepsis protocols in an emergency department; critical success factors of an enterprise performance excellence program.},

An unexpected source of solutions is being imported from the manufacturing sector: lean thinking. Lean Principles for Healthcare presents a conceptual framework, management principles, and practical tools for professionals tasked with designing and implementing modern, streamlined healthcare systems or overhauling faulty ones. Focusing on core components such as knowledge management, e-health, patient-centeredness, and collaborative care, chapters illustrate lean concepts in action across specialties (as diverse as nursing, urology, and emergency care) and around the globe. Extended case examples show health systems responding to consumer needs and provider realities with equal efficiency and effectiveness, and improved quality and patient outcomes. Further, contributors tackle the gamut of technological, medical, cultural, and business issues, among them: Initiatives of service-oriented architecture towards performance improvement Adapted lean thinking for emergency departments Lean thinking in dementia care through smart assistive technology Supporting preventive healthcare with persuasive services Value stream mapping for lean healthcare A technology mediated solution to reduce healthcare disparities Geared toward both how lean ideas can be carried out and how they are being used successfully in the real world, Lean Principles for Healthcare not only brings expert knowledge to healthcare managers and health services researchers but to all who have an interest in superior healthcare delivery.},

	abstract = {More than 70\% of people are working in offices or service industries still applying inefficient processes bearing Muda. However, they are not yet conscious that digitalization will change their life. Whereas during the last years many manufacturing shopfloors have been optimized according to Lean principles preparing for Industry 4.0, Lean management initiatives in the offices often failed or have not exploited the full potential of Lean. The causes might be attributable to the fact that Lean Office initiatives seldom went beyond 5S, {VSM}, and searching for the seven wastes – they lacked the holistic integrated approach; indeed, how to apply {TPM}, {SMED}, or flow on pull in office processes? This book goes beyond searching for Muda by Gemba walk; the aim is to industrialize the office environment in view of the new digitalization challenge by applying the same principles of Lean industry. Whereas the basic process theory remains valid, the Lean tools have to be adapted and transposed to the office characteristics where not machines but employees are at the center of the transactions. Here, a new, already successfully applied, integrated, industry-derived, and systematic approach is presented. It will not only boost office effectiveness and productivity as well as shortening lead-time of office routines far beyond simple Muda elimination, but it will also prepare the processes in view of the upcoming digitalization era.},
